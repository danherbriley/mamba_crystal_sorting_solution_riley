# My crystal sorting algorithm

My crystal sorting algorithm is implemented by the file [myplacer.py](./myplacer.py). The other python files which run and test the algorithm were created by Damian Waloszek and Petr Cermak.

# Algorithm and task specification

The goal is to design and implement an algorithm that places random shapes (crystals) on a round plate. The shapes are supposed to be packed as tightly as possible and are introduced one by one (the algorithm does not know what shape will come next). The shapes can also be oriented in multiple directions (dependent on the type of the crystal's lattice). The time limit to place one shape is 1 second. 


My solution to this task is described in [SOLUTION_DESCRIPTION.md](./SOLUTION_DESCRIPTION.md).
